# Line-of-Best-Fit-and-Error-Calculation
This repository contains a Python implementation for calculating the line of best fit using brute-force search. It includes functions to compute y-values, calculate errors between points and lines, and optimize slope and intercept for minimal total error. Error handling is also implemented.
